# WordParser
eJAmerica Word Parser project
Assumptions:
I made a basic assumptions that words that are plural will end in an s.
This way if a word matches on the singular, but fails on finding a second match, it can try matching on the plural.
This should be expanded to handle all plural cases.

Output:
The top word created is: immunoelectrophoretically
The second highest word created is: phosphatidylethanolamines
Total count of how many of the words in the list can be constructed of other words in the list: 89978
